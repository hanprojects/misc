# HackMIT 2020 - BestFriend Bot Project

This is my submission of the BestFriend Bot Project at the HackMIT 2020 (MIT Hackathon).
The project is to auto-respond to different conversations of users text-by-text

Since the project is worked by solo due to late team formation, the project is unfinished.
However, I have leveraged my skills in Python programming and natural language processing (NLP).
